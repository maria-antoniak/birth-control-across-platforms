### Reddit: r/BirthControl

**Title:** [Which Method?] Should I switch to the copper IUD?  
**Post:** I'm having a hard time finding the right birth control for me, and it's really frustrating. I went on the shot when I was 16 but I gained weight and felt awful. I'm not sure I would be able to take the \textcolor{my-dark-pink}{pill} consistently, so I'm thinking about the copper IUD to avoid the side effects from the hormones. But I read some scary stories on here about the insertion and pain. I'd love to hear your advice and also your experiences if you've ever used the copper IUD! 

**Title:** [Mistake or Risk?] Plan B}?? Anxious and need help 
**Post:** I had unprotected sex with my partner on Wednesday. I'm on the pill and really good about taking it on time (just 10 minutes late sometimes). My period was supposed to start yesterday but now it's 24 hours late. I know I'm probably overthinking this but do you think I could be pregnant? Should I take Plan B?

### WebMD

**Review:** Everyone is different, but I wanted to share my personal experience with [brand name]. I'm 25 years old and 135 pounds, and I've been using [brand name] for two years. I'm not the best at taking it at the same time every day, and I get side effects that bother me a lot. It lowers my libido which I've never experienced before, and I feel like it lowers my overall energy. I don't recommend this pill. 


### Twitter

**Tweet:** Hello everyone! I'm looking for a new birth control method (not the pill!), I still have a really long period. Help, I need advice!

**Tweet:** Researchers have introduced an experimental hormone for male contraception [URL]
