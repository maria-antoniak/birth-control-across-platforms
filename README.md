# Birth Control Across Platforms

<br>

## Lexicons

Please see the full paper, linked below, for descriptions of these lexicons and their development.

### Methods

The birth control methods lexicon includes keywords lists for each of three platforms: Reddit, Twitter, and WebMD. These lexicons are used to query for relevant texts on these platforms; e.g., the Twitter lexicon includes fewer terms because the API search includes all tweets and so there is a much greater chance of term conflation. After initial filtering using the platform-specific lexicons, the Reddit lexicon can be applied to all three platforms to determine which method is most mentioned.

### Side Effects

The side effects is shared across the platforms. We assume that the queried texts have already been filtered to mention one or more of the methods above, and so the challenges facing the methods lexicon (e.g., cross-domain texts on Twitter) aren't challenges for the side effects lexicon.
